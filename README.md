# Covid Data Analysis Project

Hello :)

In this project I have decided to some Data Exploration. The softwares I used to for the project are Excel and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. Later 
I used Tableau to visualize the data which I will leave screenshots and a link for as well.

The project explores the worldwide data of covid results, such as the total cases, deaths, vaccinations, etc.

Here are a few screenshots of the code in action

In the script there are two sections the first is for Tableau (First 4 Queries)and the other is just for testing. After running the queries I later put the tables through 
Excel and then to Tableau. 

Here is a screenshot of the Dashboard and the link under it.
